    <h2>Parippu Vada is a traditional evening snack of Kerala</h2>
    <p>Parippu Vada is a form of fritters made with lentils, usually chana dal (Bengal Gram or Split Chickpea Lentils) and toor dal(Split Pigeon Peas). 
    These lentils are first soaked for a few hours, ground coarsely, and then mixed with finely chopped onions, ginger, green chilies, and curry leaves. 
    Small balls are made and flattened which are then deep-fried in oil.</p>
